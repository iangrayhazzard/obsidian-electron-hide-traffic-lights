## Obsidian Electron Hide Traffic Lights

Hides the traffic lights on MacOS using the electron traffic light offset API. Looks great with the minimal theme.

**You will have to close, minimize, and fullscreen the app using shortcuts or the topbar menu since the traffic lights will not be accessible!**

_Note: this plugin will not do anything on other operating systems or mobile devices_
